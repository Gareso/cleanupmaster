# Cleanup Master

> The ultimate frame-by-frame cleanup and shape layer workflow toolbar for Adobe After Effects.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

Cleanup Master is the result of over 2 years of relentless experimentation and real-world use, searching for a better cleanup workflow in After Effects. While it was designed with frame-by-frame cleanup in mind, its tools are useful for *any* kind of shape layer work.

## 🎨 Overview

Cleanup Master was developed to streamline the animation cleanup process but quickly evolved into a comprehensive shape layer workflow toolkit. With this toolbar, you can:

* Solo, hide, and isolate shape groups.
* Create and attach nulls to path points.
* Rename shape groups and update expressions.
* Invert opacity with one click.
* Add masks, remove expressions, create shading groups, and more.

## 🧰 Features

### 🔹 Solo Functions

* **Solo Selected Shapes**: Solo shapes by selecting points in the comp viewer or the timeline.
* **Hide Selected Shapes**: Hide selected shapes quickly.
* **Restore Shape Visibility**: Reveal all hidden shapes and groups.

### 🔹 Create Nulls from Paths

* **Point-Based Selection**: Simply select points in the comp viewer — no need to select path properties manually.
* **Zero Transform**: Zero all transform properties of shape groups without moving anything. Works even with animations.
* **Nulls Follow Points**: Attach nulls to shape points with adjustable index sliders. Hold `Alt/Opt` to skip rotation.
* **Trace Path**: Generate a null that travels along the path. Hold `Alt/Opt` to skip rotation.

### 🔹 Other Tools

* **Rename and Update Expressions**: Rename shape groups and update references. Hold `Alt` to reveal paths in the timeline and press `SS` to isolate.
* **Parent Shape Group to Null**: Keep animations tidy by parenting shape groups to nulls — without affecting layer-level transformations.
* **Clone + Invert Opacity**: Clone shape groups, invert their opacity and stack them automatically.

  * Hold `Alt/Opt` to cleanly remove pairs.
  * Hold `Cmd/Ctrl` to zero opacity instead.
* **Copy & Paste Shape State**: Copy the current state of selected paths. Hold `Alt/Opt` while clicking to paste.
* **Collapse Selected Points**: Collapse vertices. Hold `Alt/Opt` to collapse bezier handles too.
* **Delete Points & Keep Animation**: Delete points from specific keyframes without affecting others. Use cautiously.
* **Create Masks from Paths**: Generate a new layer with mask copies of selected shapes — great for masking details.
* **Create Shade Group**: Clone selected shapes into a new group for shading or effects using all After Effects tools.
* **Remove Expressions**: Strip expressions from entire layers or selected shape groups.

## 💡 Tips & Notes

* Many functions support `Alt/Opt` or `Cmd/Ctrl` modifiers — hover tooltips inside the UI will guide you.
* Press `SS` to isolate shape groups and their keyframes in the timeline.
* Group names are used for linking, so renaming via the toolbar ensures references are updated correctly.
