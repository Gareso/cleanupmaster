# Cleanup Master


Cleanup Master is a powerful After Effects tool that streamlines shape layer workflows, making complex cleanup tasks faster, smarter, and easier.
This toolbar is the result of more than 2 years of relentless search for a better cleanup workflow in After Effects with a bunch of breakthroughs along the way.

Although Itâ€™s marketed as a cleanup tool, its features are incredibly useful for any shape layer work in After Effects.

<strong>I hope you enjoy using it!</strong>
